# C_programming_challenges
this repo is about some C challenges to practice the language .

Challenge 1: Information Display
Write a program in C that will allow you to display your personal information: Last name, first name, Age, Gender and phone number.
The data is entered from the keyboard.

Challenge 2: Temperature Display
Write a program that asks for the temperature in Fahrenheit and transforms it into degrees Celsius and displays the sensation felt (very cold, cold, hot, very hot) The formula:C = (F-32)/1.8

Challenge 3: Calculates and displays the result in decimal format
a and b are two integers entered on the keyboard, calculate and display a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b, a%b in decimal format, and taking care of the human / machine interface. (a/b gives the quotient of the division, a%b gives the rest of the division)

Challenge 4: Average and sum of 4 numbers
Write a program in C to find the sum and mean of four numbers. Take input from the end user. Explanation: Let be three numbers a, b and c then, Sum = (a+b+c) and, Average = sum/3

Challenge 5: Distance between two points
Write a C program to find the distance between two given points. The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. To find the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), it is enough to use the coordinates of these ordered pairs and apply the formula. Distance Formula Suppose we have two points M and N, whose coordinates are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) respectively. Their distance can be represented by MN and can be calculated according to the formula below, The first point (M):- (x1, y1) Second point (N): (x2, y2) Distance (MN):- √((x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2) Example:- M = (4, 8) N = (12, 14) Then the distance between M and N is MN = √((12-4)2 + (14-8)2) = √(64 + 36) = √(100) = 10

Challenge 6: Circumference of a circle
Write a program to find the circumference of a circle. Take the radius of the circle as the user input. The formula for, the circumference of the circle = 2nr; where r is the radius.

Challenge 7: Three-digit integer in reverse order
Write a C program to display a three-digit integer in reverse order without using the loop. For example, if the integer is 234, its inverse is 432.

Challenge 8: Display of the octal and hexadecimal equivalent value
Write a C program to display the equivalent value in octal and hexadecimal. Enter an integer number and display its equivalent value in octal and hexadecimal.
